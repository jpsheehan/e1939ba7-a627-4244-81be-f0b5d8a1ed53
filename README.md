# Specification

## Problem

We want to automatically update Terraform https://www.terraform.io/ on our deployment server every week.

## Guide

- Our deployment server is either Windows Server 2019 or a modern Linux distro, you may choose the one that suits you for this challenge
- Use a scripting/programming language you are comfortable with, be ready to justify your choice
- Please upload your work to a Github repository and share the URL with us

# Solution

I have chosen to use a modern Linux distro as the operating system that my solution will run on.
I have also chosen to use POSIX shell as my scripting language.

My solutions to each challenge are as follows:

- [Challenge 1](./challenge_1)
- [Challenge 2](./challenge_2)
- [Challenge 3](./challenge_3)
- [Challenge 4](./challenge_4)
- [Challenge 5](./challenge_5)
